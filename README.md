# MERN Blog Manager

A full-stack MERN application designed for creating, managing, and sharing blog content. It features an interactive dashboard for content management and a clean, public-facing view for individual posts. The application is built with a modern tech stack, including secure authentication via Clerk, a RESTful API backend, and a responsive React frontend styled with Tailwind CSS.

The project serves as a comprehensive demonstration of MERN stack integration â€” from API design and database modeling to component-based frontend architecture and state management.

## Getting Started & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- MongoDB (local installation or MongoDB Atlas)
- Clerk account for authentication keys

### 1. Clone the Repository
First, clone the project to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/mern-blog.git
cd mern-blog
```

### 2. Backend Setup
Navigate to the server directory and install the required dependencies.

```bash
cd server
npm install
```

Next, create a `.env` file in the server directory and add the following environment variables. Replace the placeholder values with your actual keys.

```ini
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=your_clerk_secret_key
```

### 3. Frontend Setup
In a new terminal, navigate to the client directory and install its dependencies.

```bash
cd ../client
npm install
```

Then, create a `.env` file in the client directory and add your Clerk Publishable Key.

```ini
VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_clerk_publishable_key
```

### 4. Run the Application
You will need two separate terminal windows to run both the client and server concurrently.  

**Terminal 1 (Backend):**
```bash
cd server
node server.js
```

**Terminal 2 (Frontend):**
```bash
cd client
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

## API Documentation

| Method  | Endpoint              | Description                    |
|----------|----------------------|--------------------------------|
| `GET`    | `/api/posts`         | Get all blog posts             |
| `POST`   | `/api/posts`         | Create a new blog post         |
| `GET`    | `/api/posts/:id`     | Get a single blog post by ID   |
| `PUT`    | `/api/posts/:id`     | Update a blog post by ID       |
| `DELETE` | `/api/posts/:id`     | Delete a blog post by ID       |
| `GET`    | `/api/categories`    | Get all categories             |
| `POST`   | `/api/categories`    | Create a new category          |
| `PUT`    | `/api/categories/:id`| Update a category by ID        |

## Troubleshooting

1. **Module Not Found Errors (Client)**  
   - **Issue:** Errors like `Failed to resolve import 'axios'` or missing dependencies.  
   - **Fix:** Run `npm install` in the `client` directory. Ensure packages such as `axios`, `react-router-dom`, and `prop-types` are installed.

2. **Incorrect Import Paths**  
   - **Issue:** Components fail to load due to misreferenced paths.  
   - **Fix:** A `@` alias was added in `vite.config.js` to reference the `src` directory for cleaner imports, e.g. `import Component from '@/components/Component'`.

3. **API 404 Errors in Development**  
   - **Issue:** Frontend requests to `/api/...` return 404.  
   - **Fix:** A proxy in `vite.config.js` forwards `/api` and `/uploads` requests to the backend server running on `http://localhost:5000`.
